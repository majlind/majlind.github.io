First time really opening a site so it's a mess.

Let me explain to others, or myself in the future, what's going on here
so it's not a mess.

Only ./index.html and ./css/ are essential. I can host the site using these alone.
(./CNAME also, to redirect majlind.github.io towards majlind.com)

The other stuff is to support Jekyll and use a modular style of setting up the page.
It'll take a short while to learn since I'm already facing the general challenge of
HTML-CSS-JS'ing a web site. To introduce modular style web site writing presents
benefits but also requires additional time to learn, especially opening mad links
to understand Jekyll. Git alone takes a while to understand via terminal!
